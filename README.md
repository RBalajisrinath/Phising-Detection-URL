This project is aimed at creating a system which can detect malicious websites which are used 
for phishing purposes. This will provide useful information for detecting phishing websites and 
alerting administrators or users. Phishing attacks are a growing problem in the online 
environment, and as such a system needs to be developed for identifying and thwarting these 
attacks. Currently the techniques used to detect these websites require manual intervention and 
inspection, which can be time consuming and inefficient. As such there is a need for a more 
automated and effective system which can detect phishing websites quickly and alert 
administrators and users. The system will use HTML and Python to extract the necessary 
information from the website. For more accuracy for these machine learning and DAA 
algorithms used are XGBoost Classifier, Multi-layer Perceptron, Decision Tree. HTML will 
be used to identify malicious code or link patterns which can be used to identify suspicious 
websites, while Python will be used to analyse the extracted data. The system firstly needs to 
be able to crawl and analyse websites for the presence of any malicious code or links. The 
crawler should be able to identify any suspicious patterns which might indicate a website is 
malicious. This can then be used to detect any malicious websites or link patterns. Once any 
suspicious websites or link patterns have been identified, the system can then analyse the source 
code for any suspicious content, such as redirects, phishing kits and other signs of malicious 
activity. This can then be used to make a determination on whether a website is likely to be 
malicious in nature or not. Finally, the system should be able to alert any relevant 
administrators or users, who can then take appropriate action. This project has outlined an 
innovative solution which utilises HTML and Python to detect and identify malicious websites 
which can be used for phishing. The system has a strong potential to save time and provide 
more effective results than manual investigation, making it an attractive option in the fight 
against malicious websites.
